### 🚀 About Me

I'm a software developer who loves turning ideas into functional code. My real passion is building tools that solve real-world problems and make people's lives easier.

I have recently started my Master's Degree in **Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity** at the [Kore University of Enna](https://uke.it/en/homepage-it). My goal is to explore how these disciplines can help me build software that is not only more efficient but also smarter and more secure 🎯.
